                <p>Hello, I'm Edga. I have been living in London for almost a decade and have been working as a chef in a fusion
                asian restaurant for the past 8 years.</p>
                <p>From a young age I have always been interested in making things, technology and playing computer games.
                Fascinated by web development I taught myself how to create websites in my spare time.</p>
                <p>A few years ago I created a game on Android using Unity game engine called 'Bubble Space Wars'. 
                To showcase my work I decided to code my own website from scratch and in the process  
                I realised this was my true passion and decided to take the steps to change my career to web development.</p>
                <p>After hearing about the 'Founders and coders' bootcamp from a friend I knew it would be a great opportunity 
                I couldn't miss. Through this course I hope to develop my skills and broaden my knowledge in order to pursue 
                this as my career path.</p><br>

            <h2>Bubble Space Wars</h2>
            <p>Bubble Space Wars is an Android mobile game that I created using Unity engine. The aim of the game is that you 
                need to destroy bubbles that comes in waves and climb up the leaderboard. There are two modes for the player to 
                choose from. </p>
               <p>'Normal mode' is where you need to survive 3 waves of bubbles 
                and at the end of every 4 levels you need to defeat a bubble boss. There are 10 different types of bosses and all 
                of them have different attacks.</p> 
                <p>The alternative game mode is called 'Survival mode' where you need to survive as long as possible. You will 
                    need to survive waves of bubbles and bosses. Your scores are displayed on leaderboards for both game modes 
                    so you can see how you stack up against other players.</p>

            <h2>SKGames website</h2>
            <p>I independently worked on the website design/images/html/css/javascript and was able to learn the proccesses of how to put 
                together a website. I developed this website to showcase my games and provide a snapshot of what the games look like.

            <h2>Labyrinth2d</h2>
            <p>After developing 'Bubble Space Wars' I decided that I wanted to develop a game from scratch to challenge myself 
                rather than using Unity. That is how Labyrinth2d came to life. Like the name suggests it is a labyrinth game where 
                the goal is to pass 10 unique labyrinths in a total of 5 minutes time limit.
